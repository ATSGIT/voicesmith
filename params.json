{"name":"Voicesmith","body":"Voicesmith\r\n==========\r\n\r\nVoicesmith is a real-time implementation of audio effects on Android smartphones. This app records an audio signal from the built-in microphone, processes it in some way and plays it back. There are three Phase Vocoder effects available. Raise or lower the voice pitch up to 12 semitones, make it sound like a robot or make it hoarse. Feel free to experiment with this app. Just try to alter your voice or of somebody else.\r\n\r\nVoicesmith can also be used to perform the Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) and Frequency-Shifted Auditory Feedback (FAF). The altered auditory feedback is successfully applied in stuttering therapy, to help people speak more fluently. Please ask your therapist to find out more. You should also know, that the lowest possible feedback delay can vary from smartphone to smartphone. Moreover the lowest possible delay on Android based smartphones is unfortunately bigger than on special hardware devices.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\r\n\r\n* Don't forget to plug in the earphones! Because no echo cancellation is implemented yet.\r\n* Try to reduce the sampling rate on older smartphones, if you have performance problems.\r\n* As you know, the software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT:\r\n\r\nNow if you have a lot of fun with the Voicesmith, feel free to rate, comment and recommend it -- so you'll get more features soon!
